Hello Everyone! This is a project to help Brazilian-Portuguese speakers learn English by avoiding common mistakes they make when translating from their own language.
The website will have a Home, About Us, Test, Contact tabs plus Contact Form, Short Survey and Multiple Choice style test. 
I'm using HTML, CSS, Javascript and I'd like to use React for my test and survey. I'm writing backend code with PHP and MYSQL.
Thanks!
Feel free to contribute!
