# First Hello Everyone, This a a project that's to help Brazilian-Poortuguese speakers learn English by avoiding common mistakes they make when translating from their own language.
Once finished the website will have a Aboust Us section, Contact Form and a multiple choice style test. 
I'm using HTML, CSS, Javascript and I'd like to use React for my test and survey. I'm writing backend code with PHP and MYSQL.
Thanks!
